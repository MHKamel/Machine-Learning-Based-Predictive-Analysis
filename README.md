![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML-Python-blue) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

## 📖 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze and predict **employee turnover** based on multiple workforce-related features. The dataset contains anonymized employee information, including education, job history, demographics, and salary tier. The goal is to train models to predict whether an employee will leave or stay using various classification algorithms.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── machine_learning_assignment.py  # Main script for data analysis and model training
├── Employee.csv                     # Dataset file (Ensure to add this before running the script)
├── README.md                         # Project documentation (this file)
└── requirements.txt                  # Dependencies for the project
```

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Employee Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset)
- **Target Variable**: `LeaveOrNot` (1 = Employee leaves, 0 = Employee stays)
- **Key Features**:
  - `Education`: Degree, institution, and field of study
  - `JoiningYear`: The year an employee joined the company
  - `City`: Location of the employee
  - `PaymentTier`: Salary classification level
  - `Age`: Employee's age
  - `Gender`: Gender identity
  - `EverBenched`: Whether an employee had gaps in assigned work
  - `Experience`: Years worked in the current domain

## 🚀 Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed and then install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, manually install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## 🔧 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-assignment.git
cd machine-learning-assignment
python machine_learning_assignment.py
```

## ⚡ Models Used
The script evaluates three different machine learning models:
- ✅ **Decision Tree Classifier**
- ⭐ **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier** *(Best performing model)*
- 🔹 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**

## 📈 Results & Insights
- **Best Model**: SVM achieved the highest accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- **Potential Improvement**: Additional features might improve accuracy further.

## 📌 Notes
- The dataset assumes the year is 2023 for tenure calculations.
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were used to optimize models.

## 🛠 Future Enhancements
- 📌 Try additional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- 📌 Perform feature selection for better accuracy
- 📌 Test on a larger dataset for better generalization
